# Safire Engine

Safire Engine is a 2D and 3D game engine that an idiot, first year student decided to waste his free time. On a serious note,
I wanted to program my own game engine to learn computer graphics programming and to improve my knowledge of data structures
by writting them myself (which also gives more control which is nice). The game engine is written in C++ and uses OpenGL as the 
rendering API.

***PLEASE NOTE: IT IS STILL IN A VERY EARLY VERSION, SO IT WOULD BE PRETTY STUPID TO USE THIS ENGINE TO BUILD A GAME IN***

## Building

*coming soon, although it uses cmake, so I'm sure you can figure it out :)*

### Currently in Development

building the basic data types.

*if you want to see the development logs, go see the application.hpp file here there is a list of all the changes and dates on when they 
where implemented*
